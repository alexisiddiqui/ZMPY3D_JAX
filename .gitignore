# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform. Pipfile.lock may vary on different platforms. For example, if you are using
#   Cygwin, after running pipenv lock on Cygwin, Pipfile.lock will have Cygwin specific dependencies
#   and running pipenv lock on OS X would result in OS X specific dependencies.
#   If you choose to ignore this file, then pipenv will create that file for you LOCKING it
#   to the dependencies specified in Pipfile, and while that is convenient for deployment purposes,
#   it is discouraged for collaborative environments.
#   Keep Pipfile.lock in version control if you keep it generic enough to be used across platforms.
# Pipfile.lock
